# Guess-The-Number-Game
I have created a game called Guess the Number that I have made using Python programming language.. 
You'll be greeted by the game and questioned about your willingness to play or not. The game will continue if you choose yes, otherwise it will end with a greeting.
Then it will ask you for choosing the difficulty level of the game if you select easy it will give you 6 chances to guess, and if you choose hard then it will give you 3 chances.
Have a try!
